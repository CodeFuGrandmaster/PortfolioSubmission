        <p>This is a work in progress. I'm having some minor trouble still with getting the layout exactly how I want it, but it's getting much better. The seemingly random colors and borders are to illustrate exactly where the divs and whatnot extend to and start from. Most perplexing to me is why - at the very least on my machine - the body is still visible in a spot or two. And why there seems to be a "margin" on the right side.</p>
        <p>At any rate, I've made quite a bit of progress in terms of the layout. I'm just about done with it, minus a few tweaks such as mentioned above. The next and final step (?) after that is to take care of the requirements for the entirety of the site being responsive across the three mentioned devices. A PC being one of them, I guess technically, I'm at least a third of the way done with that already?</p>
